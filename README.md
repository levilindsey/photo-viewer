# photo-viewer

#### A photo-viewer web app.

_See the app running at [levi.dev/wedding/photos](https://levi.dev/wedding/photos)!_

This fancy web app is loaded with bells and whistles. A smattering of them includes:

- expandable, animated photo grids, which display large collections of photo thumbnails,
- a lightbox for conveniently viewing and navigating through medium-sized versions of the images,
- full-screen mode for viewing and navigating through the original, full-sized versions of the images,
- a very flashy SVG-based progress circle,
- use of the XHR2 progress event for displaying the download progress of larger images.

This app was originally built to show off the photos from Levi and his wife's wedding.
